# Limits and configuration in Microsoft Flow
This topic contains information about the current limits and configuration details for flows.

## Request limits
These are limits for a single outgoing request.

### Timeout

| Name | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Request Timeout for synchronous calls |120 Seconds |
| Request Timeout for Async calls|Configurable. Max is 30 days. |

### Message size

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message size |100 MB |Not all APIs support the full 100MB. |
| Expression evaluation limit |131,072 characters |`@concat()`, `@base64()`, `string` can't exceed this limit. |

### Retry policy

| Name | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Retry attempts |90 | The default is 4. To change the default use action settings | 
| Retry max delay |1 day | |
| Retry min delay |5 seconds | |

## Run duration and retention
These are the limits for a single flow run.

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run duration |30 days |Includes workflows with pending steps like approvals. After 30 days, any pending steps time-out. Timed-out approvals are removed from the approvals center. If someone attempts to approve a timed-out request, theyâ€™ll receive an error message. |
| Storage retention |30 days |This is from the run start time. |
| Min recurrence interval |1 minute | |
| Max recurrence interval |500 days | |
| Max run history retention |28 days, per GDPR rules. | |
|Minimum postpone interval - Free and Plan 1 license|5 seconds||
|Minimum postpone interval - Plan 2 license|1 second||

## Looping and debatching limits
These are limits for a single flow run.

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apply to each items - Free license|5,000 |You can use the filter action to filter larger arrays as needed. |
| Apply to each items - Plan 1 and Plan 2 license|100,000 |You can use the filter action to filter larger arrays as needed. |
| Until iterations |5,000 | |
| SplitOn items - Free license |5,000 ||
| SplitOn items - Plan 1 and Plan 2 license |100,000 ||
| Apply to each Parallelism |50 |By default, loops run in sequence (essentially, parallelism is 1). You can configure up to 50 in parallel. |
| Actions executions per 5 minutes - Free and Plan 1 license | 2,000 | Also, you can distribute a workload across more than one flow as needed. |
|Actions executions per 5 minutes - Plan 2 license|100,000|Also, you can distribute a workload across more than one flow as needed.|
| Actions concurrent outgoing calls - Free and Plan 1 license | ~500 | Reduce the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as needed. |
| Actions concurrent outgoing calls - Plan 2 license | ~2,500 | Reduce the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as needed. | 

## Throughput limits

|Name|Limit|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Runtime endpoint - Number of read calls allowed per 5 minutes - Free and Plan 1 license|6,000||
|Runtime endpoint - Number of read calls allowed per 5 minutes - Plan 2 license|60,000||
|Runtime endpoint: Invoke calls per 5 minutes - Free and Plan 1 license|4,500||
|Runtime endpoint: Number of invoke calls per 5 minutes - Plan 2 license|45,000||
|Amount of throughput allowed per 5 minutes - Free and Plan 1 license|600 MB||
|Amount of throughput allowed per 5 minutes - Plan 2 license|6 GB||
|Amount of content flows are allowed to produce (actions inputs/outputs) per hour - Free, Plan 1 and Plan 2 license|200 GB||


## Definition limits
These are limits for a single flow.

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Actions per workflow |250 |You can add nested workflows to extend this as needed. |
| Allowed action nesting depth |5 |You can add nested workflows to extend this as needed. |
| Max characters per expression |8,192 | |
| `action`/`trigger` name limit |80 | |
| `description` length limit |256 | |

## SharePoint limits
There are [limitations](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/connection-sharepoint-online/) on how you can use Microsoft SharePoint with Microsoft Flow and PowerApps.

## IP address configuration
The IP address from which Microsoft Flow requests are sent depends on the [region](regions-overview.md) where the [environment](environments-overview-admin.md) that contains the flow is located. We don't currently publish FQDNs available for flow scenarios.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Some calls a flow makes may come from IP addresses that are listed in the [Logic apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#configuration-ip-addresses) documentation. Some examples of these calls include HTTP or HTTP + OpenAPI.

### Logic Apps
Calls made from a flow go directly through the Azure Logic App service. Some examples of these calls include HTTP or HTTP + OpenAPI. Please reference [the Logic apps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#configuration-ip-addresses) for which IP addresses are used by that service.

### Connectors
Calls made from a connector in a flow (for example, the SQL API or the SharePoint API) will come from the IP addresses listed here:

For example, if you must authorize IP addresses for your Azure SQL database, you should use these addresses.
